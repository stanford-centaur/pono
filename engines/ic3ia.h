** \brief IC3 via Implicit Predicate Abstraction (IC3IA) implementation
**        based on
**
**        IC3 Modulo Theories via Implicit Predicate Abstraction
**            -- Alessandro Cimatti, Alberto Griggio,
**               Sergio Mover, Stefano Tonetta
**
**        and the open source implementation:
**
**        https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html
**
**  within Pono, we are building on the bit-level IC3 instead of directly
**  on IC3Base, because a lot of the functionality is the same
**  In particular, we don't need to override either of the generalization
**  functions. Instead focusing on abstract/refine.
