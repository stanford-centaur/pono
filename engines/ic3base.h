** \brief Abstract base class implementation of IC3 parameterized by
**        the unit used in frames, pre-image computation, and inductive
**        and predecessor generalization techniques.
**
**        To create a particular IC3 instantiation, you must implement the
*following:
**           - implement get_model_ic3_formula and give it semantics to produce
**             the corresponding IC3Formula for your flavor of IC3
**             (assumes solver_'s state is SAT from a failed rel_ind_check)
**           - optionally override inductive_generalization
**             (default aggressively minimizes)
**           - optionally override generalize_predecessor
**             (default just takes whole model)
**             this one is special because it is called with solver_context == 1
**             and assuming the state is SAT so you can query with
**             solver_->get_value(Term)
**             However, this also means you can't use the solver_ because
**             it's polluted with other assertions. All calls are expected
**             to be through a separate solver (e.g. through the reducer_)
**           - implement check_ts which just checks if there are any
**             theories / syntax used in the transition system which
**             is not supported by this instantiation
**          [OPTIONAL]
**           - implement all the ic3formula_* functions for creating and
**             manipulating an IC3Formula if the defaults are not right
**           - implement abstract() and refine() if this is a CEGAR
**             flavor of IC3
**           - override reset_solver if you need to add back in constraints
**             to the reset solver that aren't handled by the default
**             implementation
**           - if you decide to use additional labels, make sure to add
**             them to solver_ in both initialize and reset_solver
**           - if your implementation tends to use the same labels often
**             you can add the semantics (e.g. equality / implication)
**             at the base context level, and just make sure that
**             is_global_label returns true for those labels by overriding
**             just don't forget to re-add those assertions in reset_solver
**
**        Important Notes:
**           - be sure to use [push/pop]_solver_context instead of using
**             the solver interface directly so that the assertions on
**             the solver context (tracked externally) are correct
**           - be sure to use the check_sat() and check_sat_assuming
**             member methods -- they will keep track of the number of
**             calls since a reset
