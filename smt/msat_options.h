  // Handling disequalities might be potentially quite expensive (especially
  // over the integers, where splitting of !(t = 0) into ((t < 0) | (t > 0))
  // is needed), so we want to avoid this as much as possible. If (t = 0)
  // occurs only positively in the input formula, but the SAT solver assigns
  // it to false, we can avoid sending the literal !(t = 0) to the
  // arithmetic solver, since if !(t = 0) causes an arithmetic conflict, we
  // can always flip it (as the atom never occurs negated in the input
  // formula, so assigning it to true can't cause any Boolean conflict)
  msat_set_option(cfg, "theory.la.pure_equality_filtering", "true");

  // Turn off propagation of toplevel information. This is just overhead in
  // an IC3 context (where the solver is called hundreds of thousands of
  // times). Moreover, using it makes "lightweight" model generation (see
  // below) not effective
  msat_set_option(cfg, "preprocessor.toplevel_propagation", "false");

  // Avoid splitting negated equalities !(t = 0) if t is of rational
  // type. Over the rationals, it is often cheaper to handle negated
  // equalities in a special way rather than relying on the general
  // splitting described above

  // Do not reset the internal scores for variables in the SAT solver
  // whenever a pop_backtrack_point() command is issued. In an IC3 context,
  // the solver is called very often on very similar problems, so it makes
  // sense to keep the variable scores computed so far, and maybe perform a
  // full solver reset only every few thousand calls rather than
  // reinitializing the scores at every pop()
